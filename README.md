# go-Haversine

The haversine formula is a very accurate way of computing distances between two points on the surface of a sphere using the latitude and longitude of the two points.
The haversine formula is a re-formulation of the spherical law of cosines, but the formulation in terms of haversines is more useful for small angles and distances.

# Motivation

I was coding a game that needed check the distance between two coordinate points. And as I like to create my own modules to use my stuffs in my projects, I decide to create this another module.
